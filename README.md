## 📝 Background

This project was initiated to help businesses better understand their customer base and optimize business strategies through data-driven insights. By leveraging transactional and behavioral data, the goal is to uncover actionable patterns that drive retention and profitability.

## ❓ Problems Addressed

- Identifying which products and customer segments drive the most value
- Understanding customer retention patterns and lifecycle
- Pinpointing business cycles and peak sales periods
- Providing actionable insights for improving retention and profitability

## 🧑‍🔬 Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Aggregated sales and customer data from business databases.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Used Python (pandas) for data wrangling and preparation.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualized trends and distributions using seaborn and plotly.
4. **Segmentation:** Applied statistical modeling (scikit-learn) to identify customer segments.
5. **Retention Analysis:** Analyzed repeat purchase rates and lifecycle patterns.
6. **Business Intelligence Reporting:** Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to communicate findings.
